# bgnotify-clone
based on [bgnotify](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/bgnotify)

# updates
- Disables the osascript use so that Hyper won't be asking for permissions per app
- Adds an exception list (currently doesn't support spaces, so you can't add `git diff`)
- Removes `-sender` from terminnal-notifier for Hyper as it breaks the action
